## Find-Cheap-Airfares
A Python/Machine Learning application

### Background
An application that helps us find cheap airfares between an origin and a destination place(or several) is a very common and popular tool we use in our everyday life. 

In this project I wanted to implement Machine learning techniques to serve the purposes of the application. This is because, for such application Machine Learning has been considered as one of the most reliable tools that can potentially output desired results in quick time. 

### Primary Technologies Used
  - Python 2.7
  - Machine Learning algorithm
  - Webscraping
  - DOM
  - BeautifulSoup
  - PhantomJS
  - OOP
