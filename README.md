:couple: Audience Insights 
====
#### Target Audience
This project targets on the developers who are familier with Python Machine Learning basics and have fundamental knowledge on machine learning algorithms.

#### Purposes
This repository helps us understand using Python machine learning algorithm to fetch Data online and analyze them based on given requirements. 

#### What to expect
After practicing this application, developers should have a basic level of understanding on how to structure a real life machine learning application. 

#### Pre-requisites / Know Before You Go
  - Basic knowledge of Python
  - Good Knowledge of OOP
  - Good Knowledge of args, and kwargs
  - Data Analysis techniques in Python
